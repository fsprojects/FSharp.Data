    "\n",
    "The XML Type Provider supports most XSD features.\n",
    "Anyway the [XML Schema](https://www.w3.org/XML/Schema) specification is rich and complex and also provides a\n",
    "fair degree of [openness](http://docstore.mik.ua/orelly/xml/schema/ch13_02.htm)\n",
    "which may be [difficult to handle](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-76786-2_6) in\n",
    "data binding tools; but in FSharp.Data, when providing typed views on elements becomes too challenging\n",
    "(take for example [wildcards](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-1/#Wildcards)) the underlying `XElement`\n",
    "is still available.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important design decision is to focus on elements and not on complex types; while the latter\n",
    "may be valuable in schema design, our goal is simply to obtain an easy and safe way to access xml data.\n",
    "In other words, the provided types are not intended for domain modeling (it\u0027s one of the very few cases\n",
    "where optional properties are preferred to sum types).\n",
    "Hence, we do not provide types corresponding to complex types in a schema but only corresponding\n",
    "to elements (of course, the underlying complex types still affect the shape of the provided types\n",
    "but this happens only implicitly).\n",
    "Focusing on element shapes lets us generate a type that should be essentially the same as one\n",
    "inferred from a significant set of valid samples. This allows a smooth transition (replacing `Sample` with `Schema`)\n",
    "when a schema becomes available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that inline schemas (values of the form `typeof{...}`) are not supported inside XSD documents.\n",
