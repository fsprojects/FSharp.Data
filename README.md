# FSharp.Data: Making Data Access Simple

The FSharp.Data package (`FSharp.Data.dll`) implements everything you need to access data in your F# applications and scripts. It implements F# type providers for working with structured file formats (CSV, HTML, JSON and XML) and for accessing the WorldBank data. It also includes helpers for parsing CSV, HTML and JSON files and for sending HTTP requests.

The library supports both sample-based and schema-based type inference. The XML Type Provider supports XSD schemas, and the JSON Type Provider now supports JSON Schema for defining structured, strongly-typed access to JSON documents.

We're open to contributions from anyone. If you want to help out but don't know where to start, you can take one of the [Up-For-Grabs](https://github.com/fsharp/FSharp.Data/labels/up-for-grabs) issues, or help to improve the [documentation][3].

You can see the version history [here](RELEASE_NOTES.md).
