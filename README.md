# F# Data: Library for Data Access

The F# Data library (`FSharp.Data.dll`) implements everything you need to access data in your F# applications 
and scripts. It implements F# type providers for working with structured file formats (CSV, JSON and XML) and 
for accessing the WorldBank and Freebase services. It also includes helpers for parsing JSON files and for sending HTTP requests.

We're open to contributions from anyone. If you want to help out but don't know where to start, you can take one of the [Up-For-Grabs](https://github.com/fsharp/FSharp.Data/issues?labels=up-for-grabs&state=open) issues, or help to improve the [documentation][3].

You can see the version history [here](RELEASE_NOTES.md).
