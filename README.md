# F# Data: Library for Data Access

The F# Data library (`FSharp.Data.dll`) implements everything you need to access data in your F# applications 
and scripts. It implements F# type providers for working with structured file formats (CSV, JSON and XML) and 
for accessing the WorldBank and Freebase data. It also includes helpers for parsing JSON files and for sending HTTP requests.

## Documentation 

One of the key benefits of this library is that it comes with a comprehensive documentation. The documentation is 
automatically generated from `*.fsx` files in [the samples folder][2]. If you find a typo, please submit a pull request! 

 - [F# Data Library home page][3] with more information about the library, contributions etc.
 - [F# Data Library documentation][4] with links to pages that document individual type providers 
   (CSV, XML, JSON and WorldBank) as well as for other public types available in FSharp.Data.dll.
